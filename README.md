# Air Quality Monitor
Air Quality Monitor, using the SCD40 sensor and having a 2.8" Touchscreen, controlled by an Arduino Nano.

## Purpose of the project
This is my first Project that i really want to "finish". I often had ideas for Projects and Prototyped them on Breadboards but never continued through with them. For the Air Quality Monitor i really wanted to go further and learn the steps involved to "complete" a Project. In my case the steps are the following:
* Choosing the components and Prototype them
* Writing the code with all the functions i want
* Designing a PCB to mount all the Components to it
* Designing a Case and let it 3D Print (because i dont have a printer)

These steps are obviously nothing special and are the common steps for every Project, but i never did it myself so i wanted to learn to do this all by myself. This is also my first Repo on GitHub so i'm also learning how to use it aswell.

## Hardware
As Microcontroller i first started with the Arduino Uno R4 Wifi but as my goal was to complete this Project, i switched to the Arduino Nano Every to solder it to the PCB later.
As the Sensor i picked the SCD40, more precise the Breakoutboard from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5187) containing the Sensor. The Breakoutboard makes it super easy to connect the Sensor to any Microcontroller.
